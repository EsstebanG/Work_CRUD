# WorkCRUD | JavaScript 👨‍🔧

Our web platform is inspired by the main job portals such as Computrabajo, LinkedIn Jobs or Elempleo. Offering an efficient, intuitive and secure space for the management of job opportunities. The website is designed to handle two types of users: Candidates and Companies. Each with clearly differentiated functions and objectives.

1. For candidates:
- Users who want to find job opportunities. They can register, create a professional profile with their experience, skills and CV, explore job offers available on the platform and apply to vacancies that interest them. They can also keep track of their applications.

2. For companies:
- Entities that require personnel for their teams. They can register, create their company profile, publish new vacancies detailing the requirements, conditions and benefits of each position, and manage these offers (edit, close or delete them). In addition, they will be able to see the list of candidates who have applied for their vacancies and review the profiles of each one.
